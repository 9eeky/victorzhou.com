I started coding when I was 12 years old. ðŸ‘¶

Back in those days, my friends and I all played [Runescape](https://www.runescape.com), a popular browser-based MMORPG. Those who've played Runescape will remember that it requires lots of [grinding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grinding_(gaming)) - the "best" players were the ones who spent the most time killing monsters and leveling up. Unfortunately, my parents didn't let me play much - all of my friends had passed level 50 by the time I reached level 30. This level gap was <span class="crossed-out">all I worried about day and night because nobody wants to play with someone 20 levels below them</span> somewhat frustrating.

The obvious solution was to

1. Make a better version of Runescape that required less grinding, and then
2. Convince millions of players to play my version instead.

With this foolproof 2-step plan in place, I set out to complete Step 1. I remember googling "_How was Runescape made_," reading that it was built in Java, and then googling "_How to code in Java_." Over the next 20 minutes, I would come to realize that learning Java on your own as a 12-year-old is not that easy. Thus, I made the brilliant decision to pivot: I would now make a better version of Runescape **_without writing any code_**. <span class="emph-special">I'll just not do the parts that require coding</span>, I thought. <span class="emph-special">This way, I'll finish it faster, too</span>. See? Brilliant.

I ended up actually finding a way to make games without writing code: [GameMaker](https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker). I downloaded it and began making simple, codeless games. One of my favorite memories from middle school was bringing a USB loaded with a [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders)-style game I'd made to the computer lab and passing it around between my friends. That proud feeling of seeing people use something you built has been driving me ever since.

Despite my ambitions, I eventually realized that you can't actually do much without writing code. Luckily, Game Maker supported a proprietary programming language called the [GameMaker Language](https://docs.yoyogames.com/source/dadiospice/002_reference/001_gml%20language%20overview/) (GML) that had lots of examples and tutorials for it online. I reluctantly decided to learn a bit of GML so I could make more advanced games (read: Runescape). Those were my first `if` statements and `for` loops! That's right. **My first programming language was GML**. ðŸ˜²

I've learned and <a href="/about" target="_blank">accomplished</a> a lot in the decade since then, but not enough. Runescape is still alive to this day. I guess everyone has their white whale...

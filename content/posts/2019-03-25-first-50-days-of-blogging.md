I started this blog at the beginning of last month (February 2019) because:

- I wanted to become a better writer.
- I felt like I had some interesting/useful things to say.
- I'd <a href="/about/" target="_blank">sold both of my main side projects</a> and wanted a new challenge.
- I didn't like [the old victorzhou.com](https://github.com/vzhou842/victorzhou.com-old) and had been itching to rewrite it for a while.

On February 4, I published <a href="/blog/better-profanity-detection-with-scikit-learn/" target="_blank">my first blog post</a> and started my journey. Since then, I've

- Published 6 blog posts.
- Gotten 70k pageviews.
- Received 600+ subscribers to [my newsletter](http://eepurl.com/gf8JCX).

## Some More Stats

Here's a graph of my blog's pageviews since its beginning:

![](/media/first-50-days-post/pageviews.png)

The two spikes are both because of Hacker New posts: first from [this one on my Javascript bug post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19135552) and then [this one on my Neural Networks post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19320217). I considered titling this blog post _How I got 70,000 Page Views in My First 50 Days Blogging_ because clickbait apparently works, but there wouldn't be much for me to say - I got lucky on Hacker News.

Here are my 6 blog posts, ranked by number of pageviews:

| Page | Pageviews |

| <a class="no-underline" href="/blog/intro-to-neural-networks/" target="_blank">/blog/intro-to-neural-networks/</a> | 35,605 |

## Goals for Year One

I'm going to keep blogging! During Year One, I'm aiming to

- Publish 50 blog posts.
- Get a million pageviews.
- Grow [my newsletter](http://eepurl.com/gf8JCX) to 10,000 subscribers.

Are these goals pretty ambitious? Definitely. But I might as well aim high, right?

Anyways, thank you to everyone who's been following my blog for the past two months. See you all on February 4, 2020, for the Year One recap ðŸŽ‰.

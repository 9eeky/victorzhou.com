Back in early 2016, I started building an HTML5 web game called [GeoArena Online](https://geoarena.online). At the time, I was a moderately experienced programmer but was **_very_** new to web development. Having never heard of module bundlers before, I instead gradually evolved a series of my own approaches for serving Javascript on the web. This post explores the problems with those approaches and explains **why you should be using** [**Webpack**](https://webpack.js.org/) **instead**.

> Note: Iâ€™m trying to encourage using module bundlers, **but not necessarily specifically Webpack**â€Šâ€”â€Šthere are other good bundlers out there like [Browserify](http://browserify.org/), [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en), and [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/).

## Stage 1: One file = One script

In the very beginning, I separated my client Javascript into a few files and included all of them in my HTML with `<script>` tags. Hereâ€™s how the scripts section in my `index.html` looked on Day 1 of building GeoArena:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.socket.io/socket.io-1.4.5.js"></script>
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js"></script>
<script src="/js/geoarena-networking.js"></script>
<script src="/js/geoarena-game.js"></script>
```

_This works great!_, I thought. _Iâ€™ll just put my networking code in `geoarena-networking.js` and everything else in `geoarena-game.js`_.

As it turns out, splitting the code for an entire web game into only two files doesnâ€™t actually work ðŸ¤·. Hereâ€™s that same scripts section one week later:

```html
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/socket.io/1.4.6/socket.io.min.js"></script>
<script src="/geoarena-constants.js"></script>
<script src="/js/geoarena-menu.js"></script>
<script src="/js/geoarena-networking.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/es5-shim/4.0.5/es5-shim.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/es6-shim/0.23.0/es6-shim.min.js"></script>
<script src="/js/timesync.min.js"></script>
<script src="/js/geoarena-resources.js"></script>
<script src="/js/Sprite.js"></script>
<script src="/js/Particles.js"></script>
<script src="/InputEvent.js"></script>
<script src="/GameUpdateEvent.js"></script>
<script src="/ObstacleBall.js"></script>
<script src="/Effect.js"></script>
<script src="/Bullet.js"></script>
<script src="/Weapon.js"></script>
<script src="/Ship.js"></script>
<script src="/Neutral.js"></script>
<script src="/js/Minimap.js"></script>
<script src="/js/geoarena-utils.js"></script>
<script src="/js/geoarena-game.js"></script>
```

Count them. Thatâ€™s **22** script includes. ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬

There are several big problems with this approach:

1.  **Speed.** Requesting this many scripts was a major network bottleneck, and as a result my site took a long time to load. [Web performance matters](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/why-performance-matters/)â€Šâ€”â€Šits importance has long been well-known and documented. What seems more efficient to you: downloading 1000 lines of code 10 lines at a time, or downloading 1000 lines of code all at once?
2.  **Scoping.** Each file ran in the same [global scope](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/global_scope), so any variable I declared was available on the [global window object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Global_object). That meant _anything I declared had to have a unique name_â€”â€Šotherwise, thereâ€™d be a collision! Can you see how thatâ€™s problematic? More code = More variables = More _Wait, have I already used this name before?_
3.  **Dependencies**. I had to manually maintain an ordering of `<script>` includes that satisfied my dependencies. For example, `geoarena-networking.js` depended on `socket.io`, so I had to ensure the `socket.io` include appeared above the `geoarena-networking.js` include. Dependencies werenâ€™t explicitly declared anywhere, yet my `<script>` ordering had to satisfy all of them.

## Stage 2: One biiiigÂ script

The Speed problem had the easiest fix: just put everything into one huge file and download that instead! I used [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/), a popular build tool, to concatenate all of my files into one giant bundle:

```javascript
gulp.task('build-js', function() {
  return gulp.src([
      './client/js/jquery.min.js',
      './client/js/socket.io.min.js',
      './shared/geoarena-constants.js',
      './client/js/geoarena-menu.js',
      './client/js/geoarena-networking.js',
      // ... more files here
    ])
    .pipe(uglify()) // minify code
    .pipe(concat('geoarena-bundle.min.js'))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('dist'));
});
```

All I had to do was run

```bash
$ gulp build-js
```

and Gulp would concatenate all my files, minify them (bonus speed boost!), and place the result at `dist/geoarena-bundle.min.js`.

This cut down my scripts section to just one include!

```html
<script src="/geoarena-bundle.min.js"></script>
```

**Speed problem: fixed âœ“.**

## Stage 3: Immediately Invoked Function Expressions ([IIFE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE)s)

I turned to IIFEs to limit the scope of my variables. Every function in Javascript has its own scope, and any variable declared inside a function can only be accessed from that function:

```javascript
let a = 'global scope';

// Here's an IIFE:
(function() {
  let a = 'function scope';
  let b = 'also function scope';
  console.log(a); // "function scope"
  console.log(b); // "also function scope"
})(); // <- immediately invoked

console.log(a); // "global scope"
console.log(b); // ReferenceError: b is not defined
```

I wrapped my entire bundle in an IIFE to avoid the global scope and then wrapped every file individually with an IIFE. Any variables I needed to access in more than one file were declared globally at the top of my bundle. Hereâ€™s roughly what that looked like:

```javascript
(function() {
  // Global function fallback
  function gff() {
    console.error('Global function fallback called');
    alert('An unexpected error occurred.');
  }

  // Global variables
  let Constants;
  // ... more variables

  // Global functions
  let playSingleplayer = gff;
  // ... more functions

  // geoarena-constants.js
  (function() {
    Constants = { /* blah blah */ };
    // ... more code
  })();

  // geoarena-menu.js
  (function() {
    playSingleplayer = function(/* params */) {
      // code
    };
    // ... more code
  })();

  // another file
  (function() {
    // Now I can call playSingleplayer()!
    playSingleplayer(/* params */);
    // ... more code
  })();

  // ... more files
})();
```

**Scoping problem: fixed âœ“.**

However, this didnâ€™t fix the Dependencies problem: I still had to manually order files to satisfy all dependencies. To make matters worse, I now also had to care about stuff like not using `playSingleplayer` before assigning it.

> One of the more interesting bugs Iâ€™ve fixed in my time was a result of this IIFE bundlingâ€Šâ€”â€Š[want to see if you can spot it](https://victorzhou.com/blog/a-javascript-bug-i-had-once/)?

## Stage 4:Â Webpack

2 years after starting work on GeoArena, I finally took the plunge and rewrote my entire codebase to use Webpack. ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

Hereâ€™s an example of what Webpack lets you do:

```javascript
// geoarena-constants.js
const Constants = { version: "1.0.0" };
module.exports = Constants;
```

```javascript
// geoarena-menu.js
const Constants = require('./Constants');
console.log('GeoArena Version ' + Constants.version);
```

Each file is a **module** that declares its dependencies through `require()` calls and can export variables for use in other modules. All you have to do is run

```bash
$ webpack
```

and Webpack will generate a minified bundle that satisfies the dependencies of each module. In other words, **Webpack fixes the Dependencies problem**. Dependencies are explicitly declared, and thereâ€™s no more need to manually maintain ordering.

> Webpack and most of its alternatives actually do a lot more than just simple Javascript module bundling, but thatâ€™s outside the scope of this post. Check out the [Webpack docs](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/) to learn more.

## Recap

In the beginning, I just included `<script>` tags for every Javascript file I had. This led to the **Speed Problem**: loading that many files is too slow.

To fix that, I used a build tool to concatenate Javascript files into one big bundle so Iâ€™d only need one`<script>` tag. Then there was the **Scoping Problem**: all of that code was run in the global scope, leading to name collisions.

I fixed that by wrapping each file in an IIFE to keep its scope local. However, I still had the **Dependencies Problem**: dependencies werenâ€™t explicitly declared, yet the ordering of files had to satisfy dependency requirements.

**Using a module bundler solves all of these problems!**
